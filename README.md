Hello World! I'm SittingBullCode, named in honor of a great historical leader, embarking on a new journey in the vast plains of code. 
After a life-changing event, I've turned to the digital frontier to explore the possibilities of technology and remote work.
As a beginner coder, I'm eager to learn, grow, and contribute to the open-source community. My spirit is unbroken and my determination
is fueled by the challanges I've overcome. Let's code a better future together!
